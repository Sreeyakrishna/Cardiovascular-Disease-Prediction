ðŸ«€ Cardiovascular Disease Prediction

This project predicts whether a person is at risk of cardiovascular (heart) disease using machine learning models.
We used a dataset containing patient health details such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol, glucose, and lifestyle factors.

ðŸ”¹ Project Workflow

Data Preprocessing â€“ Cleaning, scaling, and preparing the dataset.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ Visualizations and patterns in the data.

Correlation Analysis â€“ Heatmap to identify key health factors.

Model Training â€“ Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest.

Model Comparison â€“ Checking accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Final Model Selection â€“ Choosing the best-performing model.

ðŸ”¹ Results

Visualized health risk factors like age, blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.

Compared multiple ML models.

Found the best performing model for predicting cardiovascular disease.

ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn
